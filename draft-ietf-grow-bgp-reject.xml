            <t>
                BGP routing security issues need to be addressed in order to make the Internet more stable.
                Route leaks <xref target="RFC7908" /> are part of the problem, but software defects or operator misconfiguration can contribute too. 
                This document updates <xref target="RFC4271" /> in order to improve the default level of Internet routing security.
            </t>

            <t>
                Many deployed BGP speakers send and accept any and all route announcements between their BGP neighbors by default.
                This practice dates back to the early days of the Internet, where operators were permissive in sending routing information to allow all networks to reach each other.
                As the Internet has become more densely interconnected, the risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses significant risks to Internet routing.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring the explicit configuration of both BGP Import and Export Policies for any External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or confederation boundaries for all enabled address families.
                Through codification of the aforementioned requirement, operators will benefit from consistent behaviour across different BGP implementations.
            </t>
            <t>
                BGP speakers following this specification do not use or send routes on EBGP sessions, unless configured to do otherwise.

                <xref target="RFC4271" /> describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) which contains local policies that can be applied to the information in the Routing Information Base (RIB).
                This document distinguishes the type of policy based on its application.
            </t>
            <t>
                Import Policy: a local policy to be applied to the information contained in the Adj-RIBs-In.
                As described in <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>, the Adj-RIBs-In contain information learned from other BGP speakers, and the application of the Import Policy results in the routes that will be considered in the Decision Process by the local BGP speaker.
            </t>
            <t>
                Export Policy: a local policy to be applied in selecting the information contained in the Adj-RIBs-Out.
                As described in <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>, the Adj-RIBs-Out contain information that has been selected for advertisement to other BGP speakers.

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                Permissive default routing policies can result in inadvertent effects such as route leaks <xref target="RFC7908" />, in general resulting in rerouting of traffic through an unexpected path.
                While it is possible for an operator to use monitoring to detect unexpected flows, there is no general framework that can be applied.
                These policies also have the potential to expose software defects or misconfiguration that could have unforeseen technical and business impacting effects.
            </t>
            <t>
                The update to <xref target="RFC4271" /> specified in this document is intended to eliminate those inadvertent effects.
                Operators must explicitly configure Import and Export Policies to achieve their expected goals.
                There is of course no protection against a malicious or incorrect explicit configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
                The security considerations described in <xref target="RFC4271" /> and the vulnerability analysis discussed in <xref target="RFC4272" /> also apply to this document.

    <section title="Transition Considerations">
        <t>
            This appendix is non-normative.
        </t>
        <t>
            It is anticipated that transitioning to a compliant BGP implementation will require a process thay may take several years.
        </t>
        <t>
            It is understood and acknowledged that operators who are taking advantage of an undefined behavior will always be surprised by changes to said behavior.
        </t>
        <section title="N+1 N+2 Release Strategy">
            <t>
                An implementer could leverage an approach described as "the N+1 and N+2 release strategy".
                In release N+1, the implementer introduces a new default configuration parameter to indicate that the BGP speaker is operating in "ebgp insecure-mode".
                In addition to the introduction of the new parameter, an implementer could begin to display informational warnings to the operator that certain parts of the configuration are incomplete.
                In release N+1, operators of the BGP implementation become aware that a configurable default exists in the implementation, and can prepare accordingly.
                In release N+2 or later, the inverse of the previous default configuration parameter that was introduced in release N+1 becomes the new default.
            </t>
            <t>
                As a result, any new installation of release N+2 will adhere to this document.  Installations upgraded from version release N+1 will adhere to the previous insecure behavior, if no modification was made to the "ebgp insecure-mode" configuration parameter.
