            <t>
                There are BGP routing security issues that need to be addressed to make the Internet more stable. 
                Route leaks <xref target="RFC7908" /> are part of the problem, but software defects or operator misconfigurations can contribute too. 
                This document updates <xref target="RFC4271" /> in order to improve the default level of Internet routing security.
            </t>

            <t>
                Many deployed BGP speakers send and accept any and all route announcements between their BGP neighbors by default.
                This practice dates back to the early days of the Internet, where operators were permissive in sending routing information to allow all networks to reach each other.
                As the Internet has become more densely interconnected, the risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses significant risks to Internet routing.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring the explicit configuration of a BGP import and export policy for any External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or confederation boundaries for all enabled address families.
                When this solution is implemented, BGP speakers do not use or send routes without policies configured on EBGP sessions.
            </t>

        <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">

                <xref target="RFC4271" /> describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) which contains local policies that can be applied to the information in the Routing Information Base (RIB).
                This document distinguishes the type of policy based on its application.
            </t>
            <t>
                Import Policy: Local policy to be applied to the information contained in the Adj-RIBs-In.
                As described in <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>, the Adj-RIBs-In contain information learned from other BGP speakers, and the application of the Import Policy results in the routes that will be used by the local BGP speaker.
            </t>
            <t>
                Export Policy: Local policy to be applied in selecting the information contained in the Adj-RIBs-Out.
                As described in <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>, the Adj-RIBs-Out contain information that has been selected to advertisement to other BGP speakers.
            </t>

        <section title="Changes to RFC4271">
            <t>
                This section describes the Updates to <xref target="RFC4271" /> that define the default behavior of a BGP speaker when there are no Import or Export Policies associated with a particular EBGP session.
            </t>
            <t>
                The following paragraph is added to Section 9.1 (Decision Process) after the fifth paragraph:
            </t>
            <t>
                <list style="empty">
                    <t> 
                       Routes contained in an Adj-RIB-In associated with an EBGP peer SHALL NOT be considered in the Decision Process if no explicit Import Policy has been defined.
                   </t>
               </list>
           </t>
			<t>
                The following paragraph is added to Section 9.1.3 (Phase 3: Route Dissemination) after the third paragraph:
            </t>
            <t>
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>
                        Routes SHALL NOT be added to an Adj-RIB-Out associated with an EBGP peer if no explicit Export Policy has been defined.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                A failure of the PIB SHOULD be considered as if no Import or Export Policy is associated with the affected EBGP sessions.
                The behavior described above MAY be disabled by explicit configuration.

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                Permissive default routing policies can result in inadvertent effects such as route leaks <xref target="RFC7908" />, in general resulting in rerouting of traffic through an unexpected path.
                While it is possible for an operator to use monitoring to detect unexpected flows, there is no general framework that can be applied.
                These policies also have the potential of exposing software defects or misconfigurations that could have unforeseen technical and business impacting effects.
            </t>
            <t>
                update to RFC4271 specified in this document is aimed at eliminating those inadvertent effects.
                Operators must explicitly configure Import and Export Policies to achieve their expected goals.
                There is of course no protection against a malicious or incorrect explicit configuration.
            </t>
            <t>
                The security considerations described in <xref target="RFC4271" /> and the vulnerability analysis discussed in <xref target="RFC4272" /> also apply to this document.
