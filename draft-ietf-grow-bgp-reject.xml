                when there is no import or export policy associated with
                an External BGP session.

        <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
            <t>
                BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> speakers have many default
                settings which need to be revisited as part of improving
                the routing ecosystem.  There is a need to provide guidance
                to BGP implementers for the default behaviors of a well
                functioning Internet ecosystem.  Routing leaks <xref
                target="RFC7908" /> are part of the problem, but software
                defects and operator misconfigurations are just a few of
                the attacks on Internet stability we aim to address.
            </t>

            <t>
                Many deployed BGP speakers send and accept any and all route
                announcements between their BGP neighbors by default. This
                practice dates back to the early days of the Internet, where
                operators were permissive in sending routing information to
                allow all networks to reach each other.  As the Internet has
                become more densely interconnected, the risk of a misbehaving
                BGP speaker poses significant risks to Internet routing.
            </t>

            <t>
                This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring the explicit configuration of a BGP import and export policy for any External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or confederation boundaries for all enabled address families.
                When this solution is implemented, BGP speakers do not accept or send routes without policies configured on EBGP sessions.

            <t>
                The following requirements apply to the solution described in
                this document:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Software MUST consider any routes ineligible for route selection (<xref target="RFC4271">section 9.1.1</xref>), if no import policy was configured for the EBGP peer.</t>
                    <t>Software MUST NOT advertise any routes to an EBGP peer, if no export policy was configured.</t>
                    <t>Software SHOULD fall back to an "import nothing" and "export nothing" mode following failure of internal components, such as a policy engine.</t>
                    <t>Software MUST operate in this mode by default.</t>
                    <t>Software MAY provide a configuration option to disable this security capability.</t>

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This document addresses a basic routing security flaw
                caused by permissive default routing policy configurations.
                Operators need implementers to address this problem with
                more secure defaults to mitigate collateral damage on
                Internet routing. Inadvertent or adversarial advertisements
                cause business impact that can be mitigated by a secure
                default behavior.
